# About Your Digital Mentor Podcast
The digital mentor podcast is a series that provides access to conversations around mentoring and other aspects of research and career development for scientists globally. We interview mentors, mentees, students, researchers, public health professionals and clinicians amongst others to talk about their experiences as mentors or being a mentee as well as deep dive into specific topics related to career development. Episodes cover a range of topics including mentorship skills, relationship building, alternative careers, negotiation and networking tips to encourage and build equality through mentoring. The podcast also explores topical issues relating to equity, diversity and inclusion in global health and research. Discussions include expert advice in subjects of growing importance in disease research and global health. For example, genomic sciences and bioinformatics are revolutionising healthcare and yet there are gross limitations in expertise and mentorship in many parts of the world. Therefore, podcast guests consist largely of biomedical scientists and practitioners involved in work related to genomic science applications and health research globally.
