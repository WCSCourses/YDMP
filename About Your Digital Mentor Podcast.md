# About Your Digital Mentor Podcast
The digital mentor podcast is a series that provides access to conversations around mentoring and other aspects of research and career development for scientists globally. We interview mentors, mentees, students, researchers, public health professionals and clinicians amongst others to talk about their experiences as mentors or being a mentee as well as deep dive into specific topics related to career development. Episodes cover a range of topics including mentorship skills, relationship building, alternative careers, negotiation and networking tips to encourage and build equality through mentoring. The podcast also explores topical issues relating to equity, diversity and inclusion in global health and research. Discussions include expert advice in subjects of growing importance in disease research and global health. For example, genomic sciences and bioinformatics are revolutionising healthcare and yet there are major inequities in expertise and mentorship in many parts of the world. Therefore, podcast guests consist largely of biomedical scientists and practitioners involved in work related to genomic science applications and health research globally. 

# How the podcast came to be
Your Digital Mentor Podcast was started in 2020 following a successful proposal by Christine Boinett to the TDR-Global mentorship contest call in late 2019, support by Alice Matimba who was starting to think about incorporating development of professional skills in the Wellcome Connecting Science training and capacity building programme. This was a contest to enhance research mentorship in LMIC regions, and developing digital mentorship resources which can enhance access to scientists anywhere in the world was a winner. In early 2020, having received news about the successful outcome of the proposal, Emmanuela Oppong who was at the time involved reviewing mentorship ideas joined the team. Isabela Malta, enthusiastically joined the ship and Your Digital Mentor Podcast was born. Over a timeline of 6 months to the first episode the team set out to develop the the podcast from scratch. Along the way, the team received support and advice from many institutional leaders, global champions and science experts who showed great enthusiasm throughout the initiation and implementation of the podcast.
