# About this repository
This repository is a compilation of resources for Your Digital Mentor Podcast inspired by the growing need to access mentorship in science and global health.

## Standing on the shoulder of giants
The very popular metaphor that “One stands on the shoulders of giants” rings true in mentoring. It is also true that mentoring is a learned skill that one has to actively pursue and partake in. Through our learned experiences in various fields in science and public health, we have interacted with some phenomenal people across the globe, peers and mentors alike, who can share their experience and offer advice. We wish to make this expertise more accessible to a wider audience by creating a podcast. The goal of the Your Digital Mentor Podcast is to share knowledge and experiences, and to engage scientists and global health experts in topics that impact careers and professional skills development. 

The podcast uses digital media to amplify the voices of those who have something to share with the world. Having developed this podcast organically from scratch, we now share our journey with a set of tools and resources to enable others to develop their own podcasts of a similar nature. 

This repository is the sum of all the ideas, practical steps and processes, developed as a knowledge sharing platform to provide freely available resources for anyone who wants to start a podcast for global professional audiences. We hope that it will be useful to you in tailoring your podcast. We would like to make this a community project and invite anyone who would like to input into this work and “pay it forward” - which is the moto of our podcast.
