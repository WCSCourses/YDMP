# How the podcast came to be
Your Digital Mentor Podcast was started in 2020 following a successful proposal by Christine to the TDR-Global mentorship contest call in late 2019, support by Alice who was starting to think about incorporating development of professional skills in the Wellcome Connecting Science training and capacity building programme. This was a contest to enhance research mentorship in LMIC regions, and developing digital mentorship resources which can enhance access to scientists anywhere in the world was a winner. In early 2020, having received news about the successful outcome of the proposal, Emmanuela who was at the time involved reviewing mentorship ideas joined the team. Isabela, enthusiastically joined the ship and Your Digital Mentor Podcast was born. Over a timeline of 6 months to the first episode the team set out to develop the the podcast from scratch. Along the way, the team received support and advice from many institutional leaders, global champions and science experts who showed great enthusiasm throughout the initiation and implementation of the podcast.
