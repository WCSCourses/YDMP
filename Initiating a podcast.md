# Share your podcast idea

Many scientists develop a podcast out of passion to share experiences and deliver knowledge often on a voluntary basis with limited to no resources. The journey starts by finding allies who share your vision and collaborate to gain support from your institution, funders or other forms of support. We have compiled a road-map to navigating your way from idea to disseminating your own podcast for scientists interested in professional skills development.

## Explore your idea
Explore your idea with your colleagues or peers to determine if the topic is podcast worthy. Determine the scope and themes which you would like to cover and research on other similarly themed podcasts.

## Develop a core team
Key tasks for a podcast include research and production, editing, marketing, logistical coordination, graphic design.

## Define your target audience
Define your main target audiences and communities which you would like to reach and why this method is a suitable method. Determine key demographics and professional backgrounds who are likely to benefit from the proposed content.

## Develop a podcast proposal
A podcast concept proposal which can be tailored for various stakeholders is a useful way to brainstorm the idea and include all practical aspects of podcast design and delivery. Getting buy-in at this stage is crucial and requires engagement with key decision-makers who can ensure availability of resources. Therefore, identify your stakeholders and potential sponsors or funders to whom you will present your podcast proposal.
The strategy should include the following â€“ background and description of the podcast and ideas, target audience, the team, podcast format, implementation strategy, marketing plan, impact, timelines and budget.
